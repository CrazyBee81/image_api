# Image API
This project is a part of the Udacity course "Fullstack JavaScript Developer". It shows the student's capability to put up an express server and to develop a simple API service. The image API allows you to place images into your frontend with the size set via URL parameter. The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of your images to the front end to reduce page load size 

# Installation

# Usage and Contribution
For the purpose of training, this project is showing a still easy but highly scalable professional environment. As such, industry best practices for safe coding have been applied to keep the code easily readable, maintainable, and less error-prone. 

There are still some opportunities left to contribute to this project. For example, sharp offers to add additional styling to images being processed by the api. When doing this, please make sure to use

•	TypeScript: To reduce developer errors
•	Prettier: To make sure all contributors will format the code in a consistent way. 
•	Eslint: To help find coding errors
•	Unit testing: For automated testing in order to find issues in an early stage and to make sure, that new and refactored code does not affect the core functionality of the app.
